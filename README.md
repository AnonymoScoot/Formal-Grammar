# Formal-Grammar

A clean and extensible Python implementation of **formal grammars**, supporting grammar definition, parsing, validation, and derivation operations.

**Formal-Grammar** is a Python library designed to model and work with formal grammars as defined in automata theory and formal language theory.

It allows you to:

* Define grammars using standard notation
* Generate derivations (leftmost, rightmost)
* Validate strings against grammars
* Convert grammars (where applicable)
* Explore different grammar types (Type 0–Type 3)

This project is useful for:

* Compiler design learning
* Automata theory courses
* Research and experimentation
* Language processing prototypes
